## About

- The Pong Wars project (AKA: Day vs Night) is a simple weekend project that I made in C to practice creating applications with their own window to display graphics.
<!-- - I also wanted to try putting it on an OLED screen to practice my embedded systems skills so I made a small device for the program to run on using (microcontroller). -->
- I plan on making an embedded device for the program to run on at a later date.
- C using Arduino IDE
- **NOTE**: Because this project is basically two projects in one (Win program & Arduino program), they're separated into two folders. The [software](https://github.com/kyriosaa/pong-wars/tree/main/software) folder contains the Windows program and the [embedded](link) folder contains the Arduino program.
